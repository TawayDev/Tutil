# TUTIL
â€”short for **T**away's **Util**ities is my personal toolkit I've made to avoid rewriting the same code again and again.
If I find a piece of code that I think is useful, or I'm writing it way too often I add it here.

## Features

- **Runtime Configuration**: Change once and everywhere.
- **Logging**: Very simple logging class that may just be what you need.
- **IO (Input/Output)**:
  - **File Management**: Each file is handled like an object, so you can simply call a method on it, and it will do what you expect.
  - **Directory Management**: Same as files but with directories.
  - **JSON Handling**: Easy conversions to and from JSON files.
- **NET**:
  - **Sending requests**: Send a request using a single RequestObject and get back everything as a ResponseObject. You can send both synchronous and asynchronous requests.<br>
- **TIME**:
  - **Time Formatting**: Make timestamps readable.
  - **Stopwatch**: Simple stopwatch to calculate how long it was from start to finish.
- **SORTING**:
  - **Bubble Sort**: Only sorting numbers for now.
- **CRYPTO**:
  - **Caesar Cipher**: Simple symmetric encryption ... NO! I'm not thinking about the Roman Empire on a daily basis why do you ask?
  - **RSA**: Asymmetric encryption using keys.

## Coding Style
Write code that's easy to read and build on.
No complicated over-engineered enterprise level code.
Simple and functional code is what I like best.

## Download
Add this to your pom.xml (Maven). The repo is being hosted at [repsy.io](https://repsy.io/) so you may need to add it to maven repos.
